# HTTP Framework

The HTTP framework in SAP ABAP enables communication with web services and external systems through HTTP-based interactions. It includes the **HTTP Client** (`CL_HTTP_CLIENT`) for sending requests to external APIs and the **HTTP Server** (`IF_HTTP_EXTENSION`) for exposing ABAP functionality as HTTP services. It supports RESTful services and OData through the **RESTful ABAP Programming Model (RAP)**, ideal for data-centric applications. While the framework integrates well with SAP's ecosystem and provides essential security features like SSL/TLS, it can be limited in handling complex REST designs and high-throughput scenarios.
